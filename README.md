## 🚧 Repository Status

⚠️ **Note:**  
The codebase is currently being cleaned and organized for public release.  
We are preparing:
- Training scripts  
- Inference pipelines  
- Pretrained model checkpoints  
- Data preprocessing utilities  

These materials will be released **upon acceptance of the manuscript**.

## 🔬 Overview

EquiSite integrates:
- SE(3)-equivariant graph attention networks  
- Multi-scale residue representations (sequence, backbone, side-chain geometry)  
- Orientation-aware geometric edge features  

The framework is designed for:
- Protein–DNA binding site prediction  
- Protein–RNA binding site prediction  
- Downstream docking guidance (e.g., HADDOCK3)

## 📊 Data Availability

The datasets used in this study are derived from previously published benchmark collections, including:
- GraphBind
- GraphSite
- BioLiP

Processed data splits and preprocessing scripts will be released together with the code.
